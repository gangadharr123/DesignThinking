**Voice Assistant** from the sidebar or dashboard to start a conversation. You
will need a valid OpenAI API key for generating responses.

1. Enter your API key when prompted.
2. Click **Start Listening** to record your question.
3. After processing, play back the synthesized answer with the **Play Response**
   button.
