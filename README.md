# Welcome to Streamlit!

Edit `/src/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire. :heart:

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

## Voice Assistant

The app includes a simple voice assistant powered by the Gemini API. Navigate to
**Voice Assistant** from the sidebar or dashboard to start a conversation. You
will need a valid Gemini API key for generating responses. Install the
`google-generativeai` package listed in `requirements.txt` to enable the Gemini
client.

This project is developed and tested with **Python&nbsp;3.9** (the same version
used in the Docker image).

1. Enter your API key when prompted.
2. Ensure your device has a working microphone configured as the default input device.
3. Click **Start Listening** to record your question.
4. After processing, play back the synthesized answer with the **Play Response**
   button.

## Running Locally

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the dependencies and launch the Streamlit app on your machine:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

Alternatively you can use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t designthinking .
docker run -p 8501:8501 designthinking
```

The Voice Assistant requires access to a microphone.
